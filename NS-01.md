# Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate

- topics of this source are based on cisco certified cyberops associate cert program.
- the general aim is to become proficient in building a secure network architecture
- once the architecture is set up, the daily tasks of the system will include monitoring the network and defending it against potential threats.
**cisco's certified cyberops associate certification focuses on network security devices.**

# Networking Recap

1. Network interface card ( NIC) = enables interaction among devices over the network.
2. Switch = Layers 2 communication device (within a LAN)
3. Router = Layer 3 communication device that connects networks
4. Firewall = Hardware or software that filters traffic
5. End Device = Source or destination network device
6. Acess Point = Device that provides wireless network connection ( WLAN) 

## Routing Process
- Routes and delivers packets via layer 3 devices
- Routing decisions are based on routing tables
- routers can send packets to directly connected networks
- the routing process determines which route the traffic will take on its way to a different network that is also connected to a router.

## Subnetting

- subnets help design an efficient IP-addressing plan by creating network divisons.
- Reduce overall traffic in a network by sharing the load among sub-networks.
- Also used as a security measure to enable easier security policy distribution

## VLANS
- popular concept implemented in most adminitrative networks
- VLAN are logical network divisons, as opposed to physical divisons.
- Data transfer among VLANs requires layer 3 routing.

## Access-Control List
- Rule-based security feature used for basic traffic filtering
- Filters inbound and outbound traffic
- There must be atleast on permit statement in the access list rules.

 ## Servers
- a device or service that manages network resources
- servers typically are dedicated, which means they do not perform functions other than those they were meant to perform.

- a single server  can serve many clients, individual clients can work w/ servers.
## Server Types
- Web Server 
- Database Server
- Mail Server
- Communication Server
- Application Server
# Redundancy Methods
## Virtual IP
- IP addresses that are not associated w/ a machine
- Enhance redundancy by providing alternative failover possibilties for a machine.

## Failover Cluster
- Method used to back up a network in case of a failure
- Acts like a single system
- if a node ( closter server) fails, another node will begin offering its service.

## Cluster Flow Diagram

## Load Balancer
- a device that distributes traffic across multiple devices
- used to create persistence when a server fails
- unlike clustering, load balancing is not aware of other servers to which traffic may be directed.

- this is the diagram of the flow for a load balancer,
- it regulates the data so we can properly limit what is being sent and how much data can be sent to regulate the servers, endpoints and etc.
# Network Security Design

## DMZ
- a demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) is an external-facing network.
- it protects the internal network by forming a layer that includes only external services.
- databases are located in the LAN, web servers will be in the DMZ, and clients will be in a WAN.
- we dont add any devices that carry sensitive information

- a honeypot is a simulated area to attack areas

## Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy
- **Forward Proxies** operate on the client side, they can be used to bypass IP restrictions, maintain anonymity, and filter web traffic.
- **Reverse proxies**operate on the server side, they can be used to mitigate DDos attacks and web application firewalls.

- its an interface for web technology, it basically an added layer for where data can flow, 
## Mail Relay Server
- simply a device, that sends emails from the sender to the receiver
- forwards emails from the sender to the receiver
- can be used for anti-spam, blacklisting, and whitelisting

## Network ACL
- a security layer that controls traffic on one or more subnets
- Restricts or allows traffic using rules based on ports, protocols, sources, and destinations

# Network Security Systems
## Firewall
- Monitors and controls incoming and outgoign network traffic
- Secures traffic between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.

## IDS
- **IDS**: Intrusion Detection System
- Passive mode: able to detect, log, and notify via alerts.
- Active mode: can take action on a threat and block/drop suspected traffic

## IPS & IDPS

- **IPS**: Intrusion Prevention System, an active IDS is commonly known as an IPS.
- **IDPS**: Intrusion Detection Prevention System, provides real-tile response to an attack.
