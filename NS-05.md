# Crytography Concepts
- Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that is employed to ensure secure communication.
- When a user configures a password on a windows 10 pc, the OS stores locally w/ its hash.
## Crytography Methods
![Alt text](<assets/Cryptography methods.PNG>)
- its all depicted styles of communication
- we have to make sure that who every is getting our cryptography that they have key.
- symmetric has 1 key
- asymmetric has 2 keys

## Method Descriptions
- Hiding = Hiding a message so that it cannot be revealed.
- Obfuscation = Scrambling text to make it unreadable
- Transposition = Changing the order of letters
- Switching = Replacing letters w/ other letters or replacing words w/ other words
- Symmetric = One key for both encryption and decryption
- Asymmetric = one key for encryption (private), another for decryption(public)
## Main Techniques
- Encoding
- Hashing
- Symmetric Cipher
- Asymmetric Cipher
## Encoding
- Encoding Purpose = Encoding is done to transform data from one system format into a format that can be sent to a different system and still be properly used.
- Character Encoding = This refers to a method of representing a set of characters w/ another group of characters.
## Encoding Methods
- Base64
- Base32
- ASCII-HEX
- Morse Code

## Base64 Python
- Data can be encoded and decoded automatically using Python.
- The Base64 library contains encoding and decoding functions
- Base64 encoding and devoding is a simple and straightforward process.

## Enigma Case Study
- The enigma machine was a device designed to deliever encrypted information
- The systems security was based on settings that were changed daily.
- The enigma encryption was cracked in 1932 and again in 1941.
# Hash Algorithms
- One-way Function = Hash converts an input of any length to an output w/ a predetermined length.
- Function Design = Any chance in the input will cause a significant change in the output.
## Common Algorithms
- MD5 = 128-bit-length unique key
- SHA1 = 160-bit-length unique key
- SHA256 = 256-bit-length unique key
- SHA384 = 384-bit-length unique key
- SHA512 = 512-bit-length unique key
- NT Hash = 128-bit-length unique key, a version of MD4.
## Hashes in Technology
- LSASS
- Hash Tables
- Key Whitening
- Forensics
    - Many technologies work w/ ahshes for more capable functionality.
## Salt
- A salt is used to strengthen a password by adding a randomized string prior to hasing.
- This salt is stored in the database alongside the password.
    - Password + salt
## Pepper
- a pepper is like a salt. However, it is not stored in a database, and the same pepper is added to all passwords in a database before being hashed.
    - Per user = password + salt
    - all users (password+salt)+pepper 
## Rainbow Table
- used for hash cracking
- predefined list of hashes
- saves time in Brute-Force attacks
## Encryption
- a means of hiding the actual content of a (plain text) message
- converts the message to a sequence of incomprehensible characters
    - Decryption is the method of restoring encrypted text back to its readable state.
## Symmetric & Asymmetric
- Symmetric Cipher = Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the text
- Uses two keys, one for encryption (public) and another for decryption (private)
## Symmetric Cipher
- XOR Cipher
- Caesar Cipher
- RC4
- 3DES
- AES
## Zigzag Cipher
- a zigzag cipher is an ancient method of encrypting messages.
## Cryptanalysis
- analyzing patterns to study the hidden aspects of an encryption method
- the aim is to unlock the true contents of encrypted text, even when the cyrptographic key is unknown.
**Letter Frequency**
![Alt text](<assets/letter frequency.PNG>)
- the frequency of letters in text is a well-known method of cryptanalysis.
- the table above shows the frequency of English language letters in words.
- using this table and pattern recognition cryptana;ysts can decode a cipher.
## Digital Signatures & Certificates
## Web Certificates
- Secure Websites: Users are granted access to secure HTTPS websites via public certificaes
- the certificate guarantees integrity, encryption, and reliability.
## Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
- Diffie-Hellman: The first key-sharing protocl designed to solve the problem of key distribution
- how it works: the protocol allows two computers to pass a key between them over a unsecured channel.
## Public Key Infrastructure
- PKI = a system for creating, storing, and distributing digital certificates.
- Digital Certificates = A system that links a name w/ a public key, which is stored at a dedicated central location.

    - the illustration above shows the PKI certifcate process and how it integrity is verified.
## SSL Handshake Flow
![Alt text](<assets/SSL Handshake Flow.PNG>)
- SSL is a protocol that encrypts traffic between a client and server.
![Alt text](<assets/SSL Handshake Flow pt2 .PNG>)
- SSL uses PKI, Diffie-Hellman, and symmetric encryption to ensure a more powerful encryption method.
