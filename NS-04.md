# Advanced Wireshark
- - - **Recap** 
- Cross-platform and open-source software
- gathers and parses network traffic
- uses Npcap driver on windows
- exports and imports network traffic files.
- wireshark is the man in the middle basically
## Capture Filters
- Predefinded filters that can be used before capturing traffic
- cannot be modified during the capture
- limited as compared w/ display filters
    - using capture filters can reduce the size of raw packet captures.
## Packet Comments
- Comments can be used to attach a note to important packets.
- Comments are saved in teh capture file for later use.
- to list all packets w/ comments, use expert information.
## Custom Columns
- Create personalized columns and modify existing ones
- set the name, type, and filters used for the column.
- Right-click packet data and choose **apply as a column**
## Advanced Filtering
- You can control display filters faster by adding queries as follows:
    - **apply as filter** - uses the information as a filter w/o additonal changes.
    - **Prepare as filter** - adds the information filter to the filter bar and allows you to modify it.
    ## Filter Operations
    - Combine filters w/ logical operators
    - the && filter can be used for packets that include **AND** statements
    - // displays packets that include **OR** statements
## Searching for Strings
- search for strings in all captured packets
- search for hex data for advanced purposes, such as to find file header.
## Wireshark Statistics
## Statistic
- provide a more enhanced overview of captured packets
- show metadata information regarding HTTP requests, endpoints, resolved addresses, and more
## Conversations
- a form of statistics within wireshark
- show connections made from source to destination
- count how many bytes were transmitted from one host to another.
- use **Name resolution** to watch domains.
## HTTP Statistics
- Provide a broader over of HTTP connections, based on the host and URL.
- Statistics for HTTP request types and response code.
## Protocol Hierarchy
- Hierarchical tree of all protocols found in the captured traffic
- shows statistics about the protocols being used
- filters can be applied from within the tree.
# File Extraction

- Files can be extracted from captured traffic
- may require manuial search to be recognized
- file signatures appear at the beginning of a file's metadata
## File Signature
- JFIF = JPEG/JPG file
- MZ = EXE/DLL file
- PK = ZIP file
- Rar! = RAR file
- .PNG = PNG file
- %PDF = PDF file
## Wireshark Extraction
- wireshark can extract different types of files from network captures
- it can extract files from five different protocols.
## Automatic Extractions
- Enables ressembly of files upon export
- can export documents, images, executables, and other files transferred over the protocol.
- the list is automatically refreshed.
## Wireshark Protocol Extraction
- DICOM = 
- HTTP =
- IMF = 
- SMB =
- TFTP = 
## Manual Extraction
- Manual extraction is done for protocols that wireshark does not handle, such as FTP.
- Use TCP Stream to get the entire stream of file.
- Use save as for raw data, rather than ASCII.
# Network Miner
- Network miner is an open-source NFAT tool for Windows
- It can be used for simple file extraction from captured traffic.
- The free edition can extract only from PCAP files.
## Network Miner Features
- Parses and extracts image, files, and credentials
- Detects operating systems, sessions, host names, open ports, etc.
- Files are downloaded automatically to specified folder.
- to start capturing traffic using Network Miner, select an interface and click Start.
- each host will apear with its connection details
- it also opens pcap files for file extractions.
# Network Monitor
- Network Monitor is a tool made by microsoft that monitors traffic to and from a computer.
- unlike wireshark, it shows which process made the connection and the connections target.
## Capture Features
- it can capture live traffic and identify the process that creates the traffic.
- it can also open and analyze pcap and pcapng files.
## Window Capture
- the window on the left displays the process.
- the window at the top shows applied filters.
- the window in the middle shows a summary of the frames.
- the windows at the bottom show frame details and hex values.
