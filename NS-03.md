# MAC Spoofing

## ARP Poisoning
- The attacker's MAC ( Media Access Control) address is associated w/ the IP address of the target.
- Places the attacker between a victim and a traffic destination
- Intercepts data and can modify some of it, unknowingly to the victim
    - ARP( Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning is a common layer 2 attack.
- The OSI and TCP/IP Model are involved here as we have a layer 2 attack.
- its a layer 2 attack because its a physical addressing, the data link which
- if you hear ARP poisoning it levers the mac address, and theyre in the middle and intercept data
## ARP Poisoning Aims
- **ON-Path**: ARP poisoning can enable an attacker to intercept traffic.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker can perform a DoS attack by poisoning ARP tables and creating false traffic routes, which overwhelms the system.
- **Spoofing Identity**: An attack can use ARP Poisoning to hide in the network. Spoofing = pretending to be someone else, or something else, aka a MAC address spoof.

## ARP Poisoning Attack Process

## ARP Poisoning Protection
- Identify duplicate MAC addresses
- Check for suspicious ARP traffic, which could a spike in our network.
- Use static ARP entries, static takes prioirity over dynamic, which is almost impossible to manage.
- Configure Port Security

- Use encrypted protocols, making it very difficult to read as its encrpyted text, theres a certifcate to not be able to see what is there. 
- Prevent traffic interception and eavesdropping.
# CAM Table Overflow
- cam table helps to properly make a switch function, with.
- Used to store MAC addresses on a switch
- Has limited space for MAC addresses.
- when a cam table is flooded, the switch will fall back to behaving like a hub.
- its in a fail-open mode, when its full like this so we have a device that is not broadcasting. 
## MAC flood Attack Flow
![Alt text](<assets/MAC flood attack flow.PNG>)
## CAM Overflow Tools
- **Macof**
    - Part of the dsniff toolset used for MAC flooding.
- **Yersinia**
    - Framework for creating network attacks,

- Network packets can also be manually created using programing languages such as Python.

## Yersinia
- Yersinia exploits network protocol vulnerabilities.
- Comes w/ ready-made attacks against multiple network protocols.
- supports attacks on STP, CDP, DTP, DHCP, HSRP, 802.1x, 802.1q, ISL and VTP(VLAN trunking protocol )

## Protection and Prevention
- **Protection**: Can be implemented by configuring Port Security, using static MAC addresses, and working w/ 802.1x. We can do sticky tags 
- **DAI**: feature that filters and rejects fabricated ARP packets using DHCP snooping.
    - Various MAC address filtering tools are available.
# Port Security
## Port Security Operation
- restricts input to an interface
- Limits the number of MAC addresses that can access a specific physical port.
- the port will forward packets w/ source MAC addresses that match only preconfigured addresses.
    - Port Security is not enabled on switches by default and requires configuration. If we dont they are plugging right into our network, its very important that at any public corperate setting, lobby, cruiseships, we really want to make sure there is a port security option turned on. 
## Violation Modes
- **Shutdown** ( Default Mode ): The port shuts down automatically, and a notification is sent.
- **Restrict** - drops frames w/ unfamilar source MAC addresses and sends a notifcation.
- **Protect** - frames w/ unknown source MAC addresses are dropped, no notification is sent.
## Manual vs. Sticky
- **Manual** - Most Secure method, requires manual configuration of each allowed MAC per interface.
- **Sticky** - MACs are learned dynamically and limited to a maximum number per interface.

    - Port Secuirty allows a maximum number of MAC addresses of between 1 and 3072 ( default is 1.)
## Port Security Configuration

- Port Security configuration recommendations
    - Enable the feature on the interface
    - Limit the number of allowed MAC addresses to two
    - Define the allowed MAC addresses using the sticky method.
    - Set the desired violation mode to two.

# VLAN Hopping

- The attacker bypasses switch restrictions and intercepts traffic from various VLANs.
- Two common methods are - : switch spoofing and double tagging.

## Switch Spoofing
- Manipulates a Cisco proprietary protocol called DTP ( dynamic Trunking protocol )
- DTP automatically creates trunk links between cisco switches.

    - DTP negotiation is enabled by default, even if the interface runs in Access mode.

## Switch Spoofing Process

![Alt text](<assets/Switch spoofing process.PNG>)

## Switch Spoofing Prevention
- To prevent switch spoofing, disable DTP on all interfaces connected to end devices.
- a more effective method is to disable DTP and configure trunk links manually.
## Switch Spoofing Prevention Example

- Configure the interface to run in Access mode and assign a VLAN
- Disable DTP negotitation
- Configure trunk links manually
![Alt text](<assets/Switch spoofing prevention example..PNG>)

## Double Tagging
- Takes advantage of the 802.1q tagging process.
- A switch removes the first tag when it processes a frame and sends it through a trunk connection.
- the next switch in line will process the second tag that points to the destination VLAN.
    - the second switch does not notice the frame's source, only its tag.
## Double-Tagging Attack Process
- The example shows how a switch can be vulnerable to double tagging, the default native VLAN ( 1 ) is used.
![Alt text](<assets/double tag attack process.PNG>)

## Double-Tagging Prevention
- The success of double tagging depends on the default native VLAN settings, meaning VLAN !.
- to prevent the attack simply assign the native VLAN a different ID, such as 150.
    - The native VLAN ID must be identical on each pair of interconnected switches.

# CDP/LLDP Reconnaissance

- Layer 2 discovery protocols, for which updates are sent in an unsecure manner ( plain text)
- CDP is enabled by default on many cisco devices
- CDP = Cisco Discovery Protocol
## Attack and Prevention
- **Interception** - CDP and LLDP updates can be intercepted and faked, and their neighbor tables which contain the details of other network devices can be manipulated.
- **Disabiling** - The protocols can be disabled on specific interfaces.
## CDP Traffic in Wireshark
![Alt text](<assets/cdp traffic in wireshark.PNG>)

## Disabling CDP and LLDP
- CDP can be disabled for an entire device, or for individual interfaces within the device.
- LLDP uses the same command syntax.
![Alt text](<assets/disabling CDP and LLDP.PNG>)
# Secure Dynamic Routing
- in dynamic routing, updates are sent among routers to map data routes across the topology ( such as RIP OSPF, etc EIGRE)
- updates are sent in plain text, w/o authentication
- this enables attacks to craft fake updates and manipulate the routers for malicious purposes.
    - Recent routing versions support authentication, but the feature is not enabled by default.
## Fake Routing Update Attacks
- **Rouge Router** - a rouge router is connected to the network and causes changes in teh routing table
- **forged routing update packets** - packets are crafted w/ false routing update info to alter the routing table.
## False Update Prevention
- Enable qauthentication: routing updates can be verified using pre-shared keys.
- common authentication methods include MD5 and HMAC-SHA.
- Passive interface: Disable updates on interfaces not ocnnected to routers.
- A router interface connected to a LAN, for example, should be passive.

# NTP Attacks
- NETP = Network Time Protocol
- Synchronizes time information over a network
- Accurate time is necessary for functions such as DHCP leases, log events, domain authentication, and more.
**NTP is a protocol that is open on every network, this is good to know about a lot more in depth**

## Common NTP Attacks
- **NTP Spoofing** - Attacker impersonates a legitimate time server and can manipulate network device clocks.
- **NTP Amplification** - A DoS attack that exploits open NTP servers to flood targets w/ UDP traffic.
## NTP Amplification Process
![Alt text](<assets/NTP Amplficiation process.PNG>)

## NTP Attack Prevention
- Configure NTP authentication mechanism
- Configure NTP access control lists
- Disable the **monlist** command on the server, its a debugging command that follows NTP protocols
    - Additonal techniques can be used to secure an NTP server.
## NTP Authentication
- the same configuration is performed on the NTP server, recently a more secure NTP standard, NTS was developed, the newer method uses TLS.
![Alt text](<assets/NTP Authentication.PNG>)
## DHCP Attacks
- **DHCP Spoofing** - A rouge DHCP server is connected to the network and manipulates network settings, its more like a man in the middle attack
- **DHCP Starvation** - continuous IP address assignment requests w/ fake MACs drain the DHCP pool, more like a Dos attack
## DHCP Spoofing Attack Process
![Alt text](<assets/DHCP Spoofing attack process.PNG>)
## DHCP Attack Prevention
- Enable DHCP snooping, which is a cisco feature. DHCP snooping works w/ a special binding table to validate DHCP packets sent to the server.
- Configure IPs for network devices statically ( not recommended.)
    - DHCP snooping is supported by a number of vendors and software companies.
- This is a layer 2 and is built into a network switch.
## DHCP Snooping Configuration
- Although DHCP operates on layers 3-7, it is configured mainly on switches.

- best way to mitagte layer 2 switch attacks in port security
- port security mode that drops frames and sends notification is restrict.
- cisco DTP, dyanmic trunking protocol is enabled by default.
- which protocols allow equipement to locate others, which is LLDP and CDP.
- Forged routing updates can be mitigated by, enabling authentication.
- why a hacker performs an NTP attack, its to hace log file obfuscation.
- continuous IP address assignment requests w/ fake MACs is called DHCP Starvation.
