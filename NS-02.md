# AAA Concepts
## System Access
- **Authentication, Authroization, Accounting**

- Access can be granted locally or remotely, users declare their identites to gain access.
- Identity proving is known as authentication
![Alt text](<assets/AAA Concepts.png>)

## Local Authentication
- user credentials are stored locally on the device.
- the device compares user input to stored data.
- a device can be a pc, switch , firewall, etc.
- **when a user logs in to a computer, windows verifies the credentials against the credentials in a local " SAM " File.**
## Remote Authentication
- User credentials are stored on a remote server
- Devices ask the server to authenticate users based on its user database.
- can be both outside the network or internally in the network. a internal device to another internal device.
- Example: A PC password is checked against Active Directory in a domain environment.
## What Does AAA do?
- AAA is a model that describes how to:
    - authenticate user accounts
    - Control access to resources
    - audit network activity
    - ensure policy compliance
- The Service is provided by dedicated servers and standard protocols, such as RADIUS and TACACS+.
## AAA Components
- **Authentication**: Verifies the user's identity.
- **Authorization**: Enforces user permissions.
- **Accounting**: tracks user activity.

## Local vs. Remote Authentication
- **Local**
    - Manages each device individullay, 
    - Secures each device individually
    - Configures users on each device indiviudally
- **Remote**
    - Central Management
    - Central security
    - central user configuration
# RADIUS & TACACS+

## AAA Protocol
- **RADIUS** - remote authentication dial-in User Service   
    - developed as an open standard  by IETF
    - used by UDP
- **TACACS+** - Terminal Access Controller, Access Control System Plus
    - Developed by Cisco
    - Cisco's latest AAA protocol bersion
    - supported by many vendors
- TACACS+ uses tcp

## RADIUS Features
- operates on multiple platforms
- can be standalone or on an existing system
- integrates w/ Active Directory
- suitable for wired and wireless networks
- Allows cisco routers to authenticate via microsoft servers
## Additional RADIUS Features
- Originally developed to authenticate via layer 2
- Encrypts only the password in the packet
- UDP ports 1812/1813 or 1645/1646
- 1812 is authentication/authorization 1813 is accounting

## TACACS+ Features
- Supported by Cisco and other vendors
- AAA is implemented as separate functions
- encrypts the entire packet
- TCP port 49

    - A cisco switch can authenticate and authorize administrative access via a TACACS+ server.

## Authentication Process
![Alt text](<assets/Authentication Process.PNG>)

- The RADIUS and TACACS+ server-client authentication processes are similar.

## RADIUS vs. TACACS+
![Alt text](<assets/radius vs tacacs.PNG>)

## AAA Configuration Example
- **aaa new-model**: enables AAA in the device
- **radius-server**: sets the server IP and pre-shared key.
- **aaa authentication**: sets the device to use AAA for login and enable, via RADIUS.

# 802.1X Authentication

## What is 802.1X?
- Its a security protocol defined by IEEE
- known as port-based network access control
- authenticates new users and devices requesting access to the network.
    - it can operate on wired or wireless LANs, on compuses, and on neterprise premises.
## 802.1X Overview
- **Access Control**: offers unmatched secure, identity-based access control at network endpoints.
- **Network Security**: Ensures secure networks w/ minimal impact on end users and infrastructure.
- provides flexibility and an intelligent method of operation
- a modern way to secure solutions against network endpoint vulnerabilities.
## 802.1X Components
- supplicant
- authenticator
- authentication server

## Supplicant
- Receives credentials from a user and submits tehm to the authenticator.
- Can be a PC OS or a component of a software application
## Authenticator
- Relays credentials received from a supplicant to the authentication server
- Typically, an accessible network device (switch or access point)
## Authentication Server
- Validates credentials that are received from an authenticator
- Determines the level of access in the network for an end user or device
- Cisco Secure Access Control System ( ACS) is used for two protocols.
- TACACS+
- RADIUS
## AEP
- EAP is an authentication framework that provides transport for the request and response parameters.
    - EAP includes many methods, such as EAP-MD5 and EAP-TLS.
802.1X & EAP
- EAP is used in almost every internet protocol authentication process.
- 802.1X encapsulates data and parameters in EAP packets

    - The EAP type, in this case, is EAP over LAN ( EAPOL)

![Alt text](<assets/EAP Levels.png>)
![Alt text](<assets/EAP levels 2.png>)
- its basically an added level of security
## 802.1X Process

![Alt text](<assets/802.1X Process.PNG>)
## dot1x Config Example
- dot1x: enables the protcol on the device
- radius-server: sets the server IP and pre-shared key.
- aaa authentication: sets the primary authentication method w/ 802.1x, using radius.
    - the feature is enabled on a specific port.
    - a port must be defined as access or trunk to work w/ 802.1X

## Kahoot
fail-open results in a successful authentication to the host, is true

- first A in AAA, is authentication
- 2nd A in AAA, is Authorzation
- 3rd a in AAA, is accounting

TACASC+ or RADIUS uses UDP, which is RADIUS

- TACACS+ uses port 49
- TACACS+ uses TCP

- TACACS+ encrpyts the entire packet
- RADIUS only ecrypts the password
- AAA Functions are independent on TACACS+
- TACACS+ allows command authorization
- what are the 2 best servers to pretend to be from a spoofers persepctive, it would be DNS and default gateway
- if i want to block people from getting access to my switch, the 2 protocols id use are 802.1x and port security
- Address resolution protocol infection, its a man in the middle type attack
- what are 2 benefits of VLANs we discuss in class, reduces network noise, and segmentation of the network.
- 2 types of vlan hopping, doubling tagging and switch spoofing
- which does log commands, which is RADIUS
